      <p>About Me

Hi, I‚Äôm David Ziklag Foster, a South African student at NYU Abu Dhabi, where I‚Äôm having a blast studying Interactive Media and picking up some Computer Science along the way. I‚Äôm all about blending tech, creativity, and a bit of heart to bring ideas to life‚Äîwhether it‚Äôs coding a quirky 2D platformer in Unity, designing a sleek Formula SAE chassis, or building interactive installations with Arduino that make people go ‚Äúwhoa!‚Äù

Growing up in Abu Dhabi and now calling NYUAD home, I‚Äôve always been curious about how things work and how to make them better. Back at ADNOC High School, I rocked a 3.847 GPA and fell in love with subjects like AP Computer Science and AP Art, which got me hooked on mixing logic with imagination. Now at university, I‚Äôm diving into courses like Introduction to Interactive Media and Introduction to Computer Science, turning my wild ideas into reality, one project at a time.

As President of the National Society of Black Engineers, I get to lead a super cool group of folks, fostering inclusivity and dreaming big together. I‚Äôve had some awesome experiences, like debating global education at THIMUN or tackling intense coding challenges with InvestIN, which taught me to think fast and work well with others. I also served as External Vice President for NSBE, where I got to pitch ideas, plan events, and connect with amazing people.

Creativity is my happy place. I‚Äôm a poet at heart, writing verses that dig into culture and identity, and I‚Äôm working on a book that‚Äôs all about personal stories and big ideas. I also love messing around with film‚Äîscriptwriting, editing, and playing with visuals to tell stories that stick with you. Game design is another passion; there‚Äôs nothing like scripting in C# to create a world where players can get lost.

I‚Äôm pretty handy with tools like Python, C++, Fusion 360, and Adobe Premiere Pro, but what really lights me up is solving problems in fun, human-centered ways. Whether I‚Äôm sweating it out at the gym, geeking out over philosophy and global affairs, or cheering for my favorite manga-inspired plots, I‚Äôm always chasing ways to make a positive impact. I‚Äôm excited to keep learning, creating, and maybe even making you smile with my next big project!</p>
